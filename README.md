# SoftRenderer-for-learning
process of learning computer graphics.

the reslut of the software is a picture which form is PPM,
and you can check it by PPM-view.

I didn't use the perspective texture mapping, cause of the structure of the program is not appropriate.
it's just a program for learning graphics, and until the end, I almost finished a soft renderer, and that's enough for this little renderer. To a more efficient and convenient program, I will go for another public production.
